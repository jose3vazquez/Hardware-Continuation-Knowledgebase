# 📘 CompTIA A+ Knowledge Base (Continued)

This repository expands on the original **A+ Hardware Knowledge Base**, covering the **remaining domains of the CompTIA A+ (220-1101 & 220-1102)** exam that are often overshadowed by hardware.  

It provides **600 exam-relevant facts**, organized into **10 major categories**, with **60 unique, non-repetitive facts each**.  

This continuation project is designed as both a **study resource** and a **portfolio of structured technical writing**, ensuring complete coverage of the A+ blueprint.
