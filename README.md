# 📘 CompTIA A+ Knowledge Base (Continued)

This repository expands on the original **A+ Hardware Knowledge Base**, covering the **remaining domains of the CompTIA A+ (220-1101 & 220-1102)** exam that are often overshadowed by hardware.  

It provides **600 exam-relevant facts**, organized into **10 major categories**, with **60 unique, non-repetitive facts each**.  

This continuation project is designed as both a **study resource** and a **portfolio of structured technical writing**, ensuring complete coverage of the A+ blueprint.

## 🔗 Relation to Hardware Project

This repo continues where the **Hardware Knowledge Base (840 facts across 14 hardware categories)** left off.  
Together, the two projects represent **full-spectrum A+ exam coverage**:  

- **Part 1**: Hardware (14 categories × 60 facts = 840 facts)  
- **Part 2**: Continuation Project (10 categories × 60 facts = 600 facts)  

📊 **Total Coverage**: 1,440 unique facts across all CompTIA A+ exam domains.
