\# 📘 A+ Continuation Project — Beyond Hardware

This repository expands on the original \*\*A+ Hardware Knowledge Base\*\*, covering the \*\*remaining domains of the CompTIA A+ (220-1101 & 220-1102)\*\* exam that are often overshadowed by hardware.    
It provides \*\*600 exam-relevant facts\*\*, organized into \*\*10 major categories\*\*, with \*\*60 unique, non-repetitive facts each\*\*.  

This continuation project is designed as both a \*\*study resource\*\* and a \*\*portfolio of structured technical writing\*\*, ensuring complete coverage of the A+ blueprint.

\#\# 🔗 Relation to Hardware Project

This repo continues where the \*\*Hardware Knowledge Base (840 facts across 14 hardware categories)\*\* left off.    
Together, the two projects represent \*\*full-spectrum A+ exam coverage\*\*:  

\- \*\*Part 1\*\*: Hardware (14 categories × 60 facts \= 840 facts)    
\- \*\*Part 2\*\*: Continuation Project (10 categories × 60 facts \= 600 facts)  

📊 \*\*Total Coverage\*\*: 1,440 unique facts across all CompTIA A+ exam domains.
