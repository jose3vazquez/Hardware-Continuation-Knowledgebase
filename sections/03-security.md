# 03. Security (60 Facts)

### Security Fundamentals
1. Security has three main goals: confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA triad). *(A+ 220-1102, Obj 2.1)*  
2. Physical security prevents unauthorized physical access to equipment. *(2.1)*  
3. Logical security protects data and systems through authentication, authorization, and encryption. *(2.1)*  
4. The principle of least privilege ensures users have only the access they need. *(2.1)*  
5. Multi-factor authentication requires two or more independent verification methods. *(2.1)*  
6. Social engineering manipulates people to bypass security. *(2.1)*  
7. Tailgating occurs when unauthorized users follow authorized users into secure areas. *(2.1)*  
8. Shoulder surfing captures passwords or PINs by watching over someone’s shoulder. *(2.1)*  
9. Phishing uses fraudulent emails or websites to steal information. *(2.1)*  
10. Spear phishing targets a specific individual or organization. *(2.1)*  

### Threats & Vulnerabilities
11. Malware is malicious software that damages or disrupts systems. *(2.2)*  
12. Viruses require a host file and user execution to spread. *(2.2)*  
13. Worms are self-replicating malware that spread automatically. *(2.2)*  
14. Trojans disguise themselves as legitimate software. *(2.2)*  
15. Ransomware encrypts data and demands payment. *(2.2)*  
16. Spyware secretly monitors user activity. *(2.2)*  
17. Rootkits hide system modifications to avoid detection. *(2.2)*  
18. Keyloggers record keystrokes to steal credentials. *(2.2)*  
19. Botnets are networks of infected machines under remote control. *(2.2)*  
20. Zero-day exploits target unknown or unpatched vulnerabilities. *(2.2)*  

### Authentication & Access Control
21. Password policies should enforce length, complexity, and expiration. *(2.3)*  
22. Account lockout policies prevent brute force password attempts. *(2.3)*  
23. Biometrics include fingerprints, facial recognition, and iris scans. *(2.3)*  
24. Smart cards and tokens provide two-factor authentication. *(2.3)*  
25. Single sign-on (SSO) lets users authenticate once to access multiple systems. *(2.3)*  
26. LDAP is a protocol used for directory-based authentication. *(2.3)*  
27. Kerberos provides ticket-based authentication for secure logins. *(2.3)*  
28. RADIUS centralizes authentication for remote access services. *(2.3)*  
29. TACACS+ separates authentication, authorization, and accounting. *(2.3)*  
30. Role-based access control assigns permissions by job role. *(2.3)*  

### Secure Practices
31. Strong passwords should be at least 8–12 characters with complexity. *(2.3)*  
32. Password managers securely store credentials in encrypted databases. *(2.3)*  
33. Regular software updates fix security vulnerabilities. *(2.4)*  
34. Firewalls filter traffic based on rules. *(2.4)*  
35. Host-based firewalls protect individual devices. *(2.4)*  
36. Network firewalls filter traffic between trusted and untrusted networks. *(2.4)*  
37. Antivirus software detects and removes malicious code. *(2.4)*  
38. Antimalware includes spyware and ransomware detection. *(2.4)*  
39. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) monitor network traffic for suspicious activity. *(2.4)*  
40. Intrusion prevention systems (IPS) block malicious traffic in real time. *(2.4)*  

### Encryption & Data Protection
41. Symmetric encryption uses one key for encryption and decryption. *(2.5)*  
42. Asymmetric encryption uses a public/private key pair. *(2.5)*  
43. SSL/TLS encrypts web traffic between clients and servers. *(2.5)*  
44. VPNs use encryption to create secure tunnels across networks. *(2.5)*  
45. WPA2 uses AES encryption for Wi-Fi security. *(2.5)*  
46. WPA3 improves Wi-Fi encryption with Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE). *(2.5)*  
47. Disk encryption tools like BitLocker protect stored data. *(2.5)*  
48. File-level encryption secures individual documents or folders. *(2.5)*  
49. Hashing ensures file integrity using algorithms like SHA-256. *(2.5)*  
50. Digital certificates verify the identity of websites and services. *(2.5)*  

### Physical Security & Policies
51. Cable locks secure laptops and desktops against theft. *(2.6)*  
52. Security badges control physical access to buildings. *(2.6)*  
53. Biometric scanners add physical access control. *(2.6)*  
54. Server rooms should be locked and access logged. *(2.6)*  
55. Video surveillance provides deterrence and evidence. *(2.6)*  
56. Security awareness training reduces human vulnerabilities. *(2.6)*  
57. Clean desk policies prevent sensitive information exposure. *(2.6)*  
58. Incident response plans guide organizations during security events. *(2.6)*  
59. Disaster recovery planning ensures business continuity after breaches. *(2.6)*  
60. Data retention and disposal policies protect against data leakage. *(2.6)*
