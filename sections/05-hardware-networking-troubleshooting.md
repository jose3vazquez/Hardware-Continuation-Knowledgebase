# 05. Hardware & Networking Troubleshooting (60 Facts)

### Power & POST Issues
1. No power may indicate a failed PSU, loose cable, or tripped surge protector. *(A+ 220-1101, Obj 5.1)*  
2. POST beeps or codes help diagnose missing RAM, GPU, or CPU issues. *(5.1)*  
3. Continuous beeping often signals a RAM failure. *(5.1)*  
4. No display but fans spinning may suggest GPU failure or disconnected monitor. *(5.1)*  
5. “No boot device” errors often result from incorrect BIOS boot order. *(5.1)*  
6. CMOS battery failure resets BIOS settings. *(5.1)*  
7. Overheating during POST may shut down the system automatically. *(5.1)*  
8. Swollen capacitors on the motherboard indicate hardware failure. *(5.1)*  
9. A burning smell typically points to PSU or overheating components. *(5.1)*  
10. Intermittent booting can be caused by failing power supply rails. *(5.1)*  

### Storage & RAID Issues
11. Clicking or grinding noises from drives indicate mechanical HDD failure. *(5.2)*  
12. S.M.A.R.T. errors warn of impending HDD failure. *(5.2)*  
13. SSD failures may appear as sudden unbootable drives with no warning sounds. *(5.2)*  
14. RAID 0 failure results in total data loss because of striping without redundancy. *(5.2)*  
15. RAID 1 can survive a single drive failure. *(5.2)*  
16. RAID 5 can survive one drive failure but requires parity rebuild. *(5.2)*  
17. RAID 10 provides both redundancy and performance. *(5.2)*  
18. “Drive not recognized” may indicate loose cables or controller issues. *(5.2)*  
19. Frequent disk errors may point to cable faults or overheating. *(5.2)*  
20. Boot sector corruption can cause “OS not found” messages. *(5.2)*  

### Display & Video Issues
21. Dead pixels on LCDs are permanent hardware faults. *(5.3)*  
22. Flickering displays can result from loose cables or failing inverters. *(5.3)*  
23. Distorted images may suggest incorrect resolution or driver issues. *(5.3)*  
24. No signal to monitor may indicate bad GPU, cable, or input selection. *(5.3)*  
25. Overheating GPUs often throttle performance or cause crashes. *(5.3)*  
26. BSODs with video errors point to faulty or outdated GPU drivers. *(5.3)*  
27. Laptop screens with dim output may have a failed backlight. *(5.3)*  
28. Artifacts on screen often mean VRAM or overheating GPU issues. *(5.3)*  
29. Ghosting is caused by slow response times in displays. *(5.3)*  
30. Burn-in affects OLED screens after prolonged static images. *(5.3)*  

### Networking Hardware Issues
31. No connectivity may indicate unplugged Ethernet or failed NIC. *(5.4)*  
32. Slow speeds could result from duplex mismatches (half vs full). *(5.4)*  
33. Frequent disconnects may be due to faulty cables or interference. *(5.4)*  
34. Wireless interference can come from microwaves or neighboring Wi-Fi. *(5.4)*  
35. Incorrect SSID or passphrase prevents Wi-Fi association. *(5.4)*  
36. Limited connectivity often signals DHCP server problems. *(5.4)*  
37. APIPA addresses (169.254.x.x) show DHCP assignment failure. *(5.4)*  
38. High latency may result from congestion or routing issues. *(5.4)*  
39. A blinking link light usually means network activity. *(5.4)*  
40. A solid amber link light often signals hardware negotiation errors. *(5.4)*  

### Printer Issues
41. Paper jams are the most common printer issue. *(5.5)*  
42. Faded printouts indicate low toner or ink. *(5.5)*  
43. Ghost images occur when drum or fuser is faulty. *(5.5)*  
44. Streaks may indicate dirty rollers or clogged nozzles. *(5.5)*  
45. Misaligned printing often requires calibration. *(5.5)*  
46. “Out of memory” errors occur in networked printers with limited RAM. *(5.5)*  
47. Slow printing may be due to incorrect drivers. *(5.5)*  
48. Printer spooler failures stop jobs from reaching the printer. *(5.5)*  
49. Network printers require correct IP/DNS configuration. *(5.5)*  
50. Wireless printers may drop connections due to weak signal. *(5.5)*  

### Diagnostic Tools & Methods
51. Loopback plugs test NIC functionality without external networks. *(5.6)*  
52. Cable testers identify wiring faults in Ethernet cables. *(5.6)*  
53. Tone generators and probes trace cables in walls. *(5.6)*  
54. Multimeters check PSU voltage output. *(5.6)*  
55. POST cards provide diagnostic codes for hardware issues. *(5.6)*  
56. Event Viewer logs application and system errors. *(5.6)*  
57. Ping tests connectivity between devices. *(5.6)*  
58. Traceroute identifies routing paths and failures. *(5.6)*  
59. nslookup tests DNS name resolution. *(5.6)*  
60. Wireshark captures and analyzes packet traffic. *(5.6)*
