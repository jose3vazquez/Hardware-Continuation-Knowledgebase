# 07. Cloud & Virtualization Fundamentals (60 Facts)

### Cloud Concepts
1. Cloud computing delivers computing services over the internet. *(A+ 220-1101, Obj 4.1)*  
2. Public cloud resources are shared across multiple organizations. *(4.1)*  
3. Private clouds are dedicated to one organization. *(4.1)*  
4. Hybrid clouds combine public and private models. *(4.1)*  
5. Community clouds are shared among organizations with common goals. *(4.1)*  
6. IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) provides virtualized computing resources. *(4.1)*  
7. PaaS (Platform as a Service) offers development platforms and tools. *(4.1)*  
8. SaaS (Software as a Service) delivers apps over the internet. *(4.1)*  
9. Examples of SaaS: Gmail, Office 365, Salesforce. *(4.1)*  
10. Examples of IaaS: AWS EC2, Microsoft Azure VMs. *(4.1)*  

### Virtualization Basics
11. Virtualization allows multiple OS instances to run on one host. *(4.2)*  
12. Hypervisors manage virtual machines (VMs). *(4.2)*  
13. Type 1 hypervisors run directly on hardware (bare-metal). *(4.2)*  
14. Examples of Type 1: VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, XenServer. *(4.2)*  
15. Type 2 hypervisors run on top of a host OS. *(4.2)*  
16. Examples of Type 2: VirtualBox, VMware Workstation. *(4.2)*  
17. Virtual machines emulate hardware for OS isolation. *(4.2)*  
18. Snapshots save the state of a VM for rollback. *(4.2)*  
19. VM templates provide preconfigured OS images. *(4.2)*  
20. Thin provisioning allocates virtual disk space dynamically. *(4.2)*  

### Virtual Networking
21. Virtual switches connect VMs internally or to physical networks. *(4.2)*  
22. NAT mode assigns private IPs to VMs and shares the hostâ€™s IP. *(4.2)*  
23. Bridged networking connects VMs directly to the physical LAN. *(4.2)*  
24. Host-only networking isolates VMs but allows host communication. *(4.2)*  
25. VLANs segment traffic within virtualized environments. *(4.2)*  
26. Virtual firewalls enforce policies inside hypervisors. *(4.2)*  
27. Virtual NICs are software-based adapters for VMs. *(4.2)*  
28. Storage vMotion allows live migration of VM storage. *(4.2)*  
29. vMotion (or live migration) moves running VMs between hosts. *(4.2)*  
30. High availability (HA) restarts VMs on another host during failure. *(4.2)*  

### Cloud Storage & Sync
31. Cloud storage provides scalable capacity on demand. *(4.1)*  
32. Popular cloud storage services: Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox. *(4.1)*  
33. Cloud sync ensures files are consistent across devices. *(4.1)*  
34. File versioning allows rollback to previous cloud copies. *(4.1)*  
35. Offline sync lets files be accessed without internet. *(4.1)*  
36. Cloud collaboration tools include Microsoft Teams and Google Workspace. *(4.1)*  
37. Cloud backup protects data from local hardware failure. *(4.1)*  
38. Object storage stores data as objects with metadata. *(4.1)*  
39. Block storage emulates traditional disks for VMs. *(4.1)*  
40. File storage uses protocols like NFS and SMB in the cloud. *(4.1)*  

### Cloud Security
41. Cloud services use encryption to secure data in transit and at rest. *(4.1)*  
42. Shared responsibility models split duties between provider and customer. *(4.1)*  
43. Cloud access security brokers (CASBs) enforce security policies. *(4.1)*  
44. MFA (Multi-factor authentication) protects cloud logins. *(4.1)*  
45. SSO (Single Sign-On) streamlines cloud authentication. *(4.1)*  
46. IAM (Identity & Access Management) controls cloud user permissions. *(4.1)*  
47. Cloud monitoring tools detect unusual activity. *(4.1)*  
48. Tokenization replaces sensitive data with unique tokens. *(4.1)*  
49. DLP (Data Loss Prevention) prevents unauthorized sharing. *(4.1)*  
50. Cloud compliance requires adherence to laws like GDPR or HIPAA. *(4.1)*  

### Cloud Troubleshooting & Use Cases
51. Latency issues can affect cloud performance. *(4.1)*  
52. Bandwidth bottlenecks slow cloud sync and streaming. *(4.1)*  
53. VM sprawl occurs when too many virtual machines are deployed without oversight. *(4.2)*  
54. Overprovisioning wastes resources in cloud deployments. *(4.2)*  
55. Underprovisioning causes poor VM performance. *(4.2)*  
56. Backup failures often occur from insufficient permissions. *(4.1)*  
57. Authentication failures may stem from expired tokens or certificates. *(4.1)*  
58. Cloud-based apps require constant internet access to function. *(4.1)*  
59. SaaS downtime depends on the providerâ€™s SLA (Service Level Agreement). *(4.1)*  
60. Cloud elasticity allows scaling resources up or down automatically. *(4.1)*
